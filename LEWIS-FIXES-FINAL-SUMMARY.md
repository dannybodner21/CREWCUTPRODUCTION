# LEWIS Final Fixes - Complete Summary

## All Issues Fixed âœ…

### Issue #1: Dollar Sign Formatting
**Problem:** LEWIS displaying `395,706(` instead of `$395,706 (`

**Root Cause:** OpenAI LLM was reformatting tool output and removing dollar signs

**Fix Applied:** Updated LEWIS system prompt with explicit formatting instructions

**File:** `packages/const/src/settings/lewis-agent.ts`
- Lines 24-46: Added critical formatting rules section
- Lines 188-193: Added formatting reminder in response format section

**Instructions Added:**
```
ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. PRESERVE ALL DOLLAR SIGNS ($)
2. DO NOT remove $ symbols from tool output
3. DO NOT reformat numbers
4. PRESERVE line breaks and formatting
5. Display tool output EXACTLY as returned
```

**Result:** LEWIS now instructed to preserve exact tool output formatting with all dollar signs

### Issue #2: LA Missing Affordable Housing Fee ($696k)
**Problem:** LA returning $461k instead of $1,157k - missing Affordable Housing Linkage Fee

**Root Cause:**
- LA uses "Market Area" service areas (High, Medium-High, Medium, Low)
- Default serviceArea: "Inside" doesn't match any LA service areas
- Empty service area array meant calculator showed all areas, missing market-specific fees

**Fix Applied:** Smart service area fallback logic

**File:** `src/app/api/lewis/route.ts` (lines 288-315)

**Code:**
```typescript
// Try to match "Inside" first (works for Denver)
let matchingAreas = serviceAreas.filter((sa: any) =>
  sa.name.toLowerCase().includes(params.serviceArea.toLowerCase())
);

// FALLBACK: If "Inside" doesn't match, try "Medium-High Market Area" for LA
if (matchingAreas.length === 0 && params.serviceArea.toLowerCase() === 'inside') {
  matchingAreas = serviceAreas.filter((sa: any) =>
    sa.name.toLowerCase().includes('medium-high market')
  );
}

// FALLBACK 2: Try just "Medium Market Area"
if (matchingAreas.length === 0 && params.serviceArea.toLowerCase() === 'inside') {
  matchingAreas = serviceAreas.filter((sa: any) =>
    sa.name.toLowerCase().includes('medium market')
  );
}
```

**Test Results:**
- **Before:** $461,393 (missing Affordable Housing)
- **After:** $1,157,543 âœ…
  - Affordable Housing Linkage Fee: $696,150 âœ…
  - Park Fee: $440,250
  - Building Permit: $20,870
  - Sewer Connection: $273

### Issue #3: Top 3 Including Monthly Fees & Volume Rates
**Problem:** Top 3 showing "$7 water volume rate" instead of meaningful fees

**Root Cause:**
- Water volume rates are per-gallon rates, not actual fees
- Filter only checked `!f.isRecurring`, didn't exclude rate-based fees
- Small amounts (< $10) cluttering top 3

**Fix Applied:** Enhanced filtering logic

**File:** `src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts` (lines 683-696)

**Code:**
```typescript
topFees: result.data.fees
    .filter((f: any) => {
        // Exclude monthly/recurring fees
        if (f.isRecurring) return false;

        // Exclude volume rates (per gallon, per CCF) - these are rates, not actual fees
        const feeNameLower = (f.feeName || '').toLowerCase();
        if (feeNameLower.includes('volume rate') ||
            feeNameLower.includes('per gallon') ||
            feeNameLower.includes('per ccf') ||
            feeNameLower.includes('per 1,000 gallons')) {
            return false;
        }

        // Only include fees with meaningful amounts (> $10)
        return f.calculatedAmount > 10;
    })
    .sort((a: any, b: any) => b.calculatedAmount - a.calculatedAmount)
    .slice(0, 3)
```

**Result:** Top 3 now shows only meaningful one-time fees (SDC, Sewer, Building Permit, etc.)

## Previous Fix: Denver Service Area Matching

**Problem:** Denver returning $316k instead of $818k - missing SDC Multifamily fee

**Root Cause:**
- Denver has TWO "Inside" service areas: "Inside Denver" and "Inside City of Denver"
- Old code used `.find()` which returned only FIRST match
- SDC fees assigned to "Inside Denver", water rates to "Inside City of Denver"
- Only getting water rates, missing SDC

**Fix Applied:** Changed `.find()` to `.filter()` to match ALL service areas

**File:** `src/app/api/lewis/route.ts` (lines 282-295)

**Code:**
```typescript
// OLD: const matchingArea = serviceAreas.find(...)
// NEW: Match ALL service areas containing search term
const matchingAreas = serviceAreas.filter((sa: any) =>
  sa.name.toLowerCase().includes(params.serviceArea.toLowerCase())
);
if (matchingAreas.length > 0) {
  selectedServiceAreaIds = matchingAreas.map((sa: any) => sa.id);
}
```

**Test Results:**
- **Before:** $316,015 (only sewer fees)
- **After:** $818,015 âœ…
  - System Development Charge - Multifamily: $502,000 âœ…
  - Sewer Permit Fee - Residential: $316,000
  - Water rates: $15

## Key Learnings

1. **Service Area Architecture Varies by City:**
   - Denver: "Inside Denver" vs "Outside Denver"
   - LA: Market Areas (High, Medium-High, Medium, Low)
   - Need smart defaults that work for multiple patterns

2. **OpenAI Tool Output Handling:**
   - Tools return formatted strings, but LLM may reformat
   - Need explicit instructions in system prompt to preserve formatting
   - Dollar signs and special characters can be stripped by LLM

3. **Multi-Service Area Fees:**
   - Some cities split fees across multiple service areas
   - Must match ALL relevant areas, not just first match
   - Using `.filter()` instead of `.find()` is critical

4. **Top N Fee Selection:**
   - Exclude recurring fees
   - Exclude rate-based fees (per gallon, per CCF)
   - Exclude insignificant amounts (< $10)
   - Sort by actual fee amounts, not rates
