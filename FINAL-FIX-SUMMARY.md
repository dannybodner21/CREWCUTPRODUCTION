# optimizeProject Tool - Final Fix Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Action to Builtin Tool Interface
**File:** `src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts`

```typescript
// Line 35-40: Added to interface
optimizeProject: (params: any) => Promise<any>;

// Line 82-87: Added to export mapping
optimizeProject: customApiActions.optimizeProject,
```

**This was the CRITICAL missing piece** - the tool was defined and implemented, but not registered in the Zustand store.

### 2. Enhanced Error Logging
**File:** `src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts` (lines 897-924)

Added detailed console logging to track:
- Function being called
- API request details
- Response status
- API result data
- Any errors

### 3. All Other Components Already Existed
- ✅ Tool definition in manifest
- ✅ API handler with calculateFees logic
- ✅ Client-side implementation with formatting
- ✅ System prompt with proactive rules

## 🚀 How To Test (Step-by-Step)

### Method 1: Clean Rebuild (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Stop and rebuild
Ctrl+C  # Stop dev server
rm -rf .next  # Delete build cache
npm run dev   # Start fresh
```

```bash
# Browser:
1. Go to http://localhost:3010
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Send to LEWIS: "I have a 3-acre lot in Austin, what should I build?"
4. Watch console for logs
```

### Method 2: Direct API Test

```bash
# Create test file
cat > test-optimize-direct.ts << 'EOF'
async function test() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3010/api/lewis', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      action: 'optimizeProject',
      params: { jurisdiction: 'Austin', lotSize: 3, projectType: 'Multi-Family' }
    })
  });
  console.log(await res.json());
}
test();
EOF

# Run it
npx tsx test-optimize-direct.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "jurisdiction": "Austin",
    "lotSize": 3,
    "projectType": "Multi-Family",
    "buildableAcres": 1.8,
    "scenarios": [...]
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Console Logs You Should See

```
🔧 LEWIS TOOL: optimizeProject called with: {jurisdiction: "Austin", lotSize: 3, projectType: "Multi-Family"}
🔧 LEWIS TOOL: Fetching from /api/lewis with action=optimizeProject
🔧 LEWIS TOOL: Response status: 200
🔧 LEWIS TOOL: optimizeProject API result: {"success":true,"data":{...}}
```

## 📊 Expected LEWIS Response

```markdown
I'll analyze your 3 acre site in Austin for optimal Multi-Family development.

Based on your lot size (1.8 acres buildable) and local fees, here are 3 development scenarios:

| Scenario | Units | Total SF | Dev Fees | Est. Construction | Total Cost | Cost/Unit |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| Conservative (2-story) | 72 | 64,800 | `$XXX,XXX` | `$12,960,000` | `$13,XXX,XXX` | `$XXX,XXX` |
| Moderate (3-story) | 108 | 91,800 | `$XXX,XXX` | `$18,360,000` | `$18,XXX,XXX` | `$XXX,XXX` |
| Aggressive (4-story) | 144 | 115,200 | `$XXX,XXX` | `$23,040,000` | `$23,XXX,XXX` | `$XXX,XXX` |

**Recommendation:** The Moderate (3-story) approach with 108 units offers the best balance...

**Key Considerations:**
- Development fees: `$XXX,XXX` (X.X% of total cost)
- Monthly operating: `$XXX`/month
- Estimated timeline: 18-24 months from permit to occupancy

Would you like me to generate a detailed pro forma or compare this to other Austin locations?

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No console logs appear"
**Cause:** Function not being called
**Check:**
```bash
grep "optimizeProject.*customApiActions" src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts
# Should show: optimizeProject: customApiActions.optimizeProject,
```

### Issue: "Response status: 404"
**Cause:** API handler missing
**Check:**
```bash
grep -A 5 "case 'optimizeProject':" src/app/api/lewis/route.ts
# Should show case block starting at line 441
```

### Issue: "Response status: 500"
**Cause:** Server error
**Check:** Look at terminal running `npm run dev` for error stack trace

### Issue: "Jurisdiction not found"
**Cause:** City not in database
**Try:** "Phoenix", "Denver", "Los Angeles", "Portland", or "Salt Lake City"

### Issue: LLM still returns params object
**Cause:** Old build cached
**Fix:** Delete `.next` and rebuild

## 📁 Modified Files Summary

| File | What Changed | Line Numbers |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts` | Added to interface & export | 39, 86 |
| `src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts` | Enhanced logging | 897-924 |
| `src/app/api/lewis/route.ts` | Already had handler | 441-567 |
| `src/tools/custom-api-tool/index.ts` | Already had definition | 320-346 |
| `packages/const/src/settings/lewis-agent.ts` | Already had prompt rules | 21-23, 113-131 |

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify all pieces are in place:

```bash
# 1. Check interface declaration
grep "optimizeProject: (params: any)" src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts
# Should return line 39

# 2. Check export mapping
grep "optimizeProject: customApiActions.optimizeProject" src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts
# Should return line 86

# 3. Check function implementation
grep "optimizeProject: async (params: any)" src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts
# Should return line 895

# 4. Check API handler
grep "case 'optimizeProject':" src/app/api/lewis/route.ts
# Should return line 441

# 5. Check tool definition
grep "name: 'optimizeProject'," src/tools/custom-api-tool/index.ts
# Should return line 321

# 6. No TypeScript errors
bun run type-check
# Should complete with no errors
```

All should return results. If any fail, that piece is missing.

## 🎯 Why It Should Work Now

**Before:** Tool was defined but not registered in Zustand store action interface
**After:** Tool is properly registered at all levels:
1. ✅ Defined in tool manifest (`index.ts`)
2. ✅ Implemented in actions (`actions.ts`)
3. ✅ Handled in API route (`route.ts`)
4. ✅ **Registered in store interface (`action.ts`)** ← THIS WAS MISSING
5. ✅ Referenced in system prompt (`lewis-agent.ts`)

## 🔄 Next Steps After Success

Once optimizeProject works, we'll implement:

- **Tool 2: compareScenarios** - Run same project across multiple cities
- **Tool 3: generateProForma** - Full financial projections with revenue

Both will follow the same pattern as optimizeProject.

## 📞 If Still Broken

Share these from browser console:
1. Any errors (red text)
2. The logs starting with "🔧 LEWIS TOOL:"
3. Network tab showing the `/api/lewis` request/response

This will show exactly where it's failing.
