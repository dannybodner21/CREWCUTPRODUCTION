An estimated cost is established at the beginning of an improvement project and is finalized after construction is complete. Property owners within the established improvement district are then responsible for their share of these costs, either through a direct cash payment or via a special assessment on their property over a 10-year period, secured by bonds.

","The City of Phoenix Water Rate Schedule, effective March 1, 2025, applies to the Union Hills area as Union Hills refers to a water treatment plant within the City of Phoenix's water services, not a separate water district. The schedule details monthly service charges, user and other charges, and environmental charges for both inside and outside the city limits.
","The City of Phoenix Fire Prevention Code fee schedule, effective May 4, 2024, includes a base rate of $150 per hour. Specific fees for various permits and services are detailed within the schedule. For example, a General Fire Inspection has a minimum fee of $150 (1 hour), and an appeal to the Fire Marshal is $250. Operational permits range from a minimum of $150 (1 hour) for items like Bonfire or Open Burning to higher fees for more complex operations. Construction permit fees also vary based on the type of installation or modification, with a plan review for an automatic sprinkler system (NFPA 13 & 13R) starting at a minimum of $375 (2.5 hours) for the first 40,000 square feet.
","A web-based schedule or PDF specifically detailing fees for the City of Phoenix Union Hills improvement district is not publicly available. The City of Phoenix Improvement Districts operate by assessing project-specific costs to property owners within the formed district after the completion of infrastructure improvements. These costs are either paid in cash or financed through bonds over a 10-year period, secured by a lien on the property.
","The City of Phoenix implements assessment district fees as part of its Development Impact Fees. There is no single web-based schedule specifically for 'Union Hills assessment district fees.' Instead, Union Hills falls within the 'Northwest' and 'Deer Valley' impact fee service areas for various services. The fees are determined by the specific service (e.g., Fire Protection, Police, Water Treatment, Wastewater Treatment) and the type of development (e.g., Single-Family Residential, Multi-Family Residential, Retail, Office, Industrial, Public, Other). Detailed schedules, including gross fees, offsets, and net fees per equivalent demand unit (EDU) or per development unit/square footage, are provided in Appendix A—Impact fee schedules of the Phoenix City Code.
"
Phoenix - Foothills,"The City of Phoenix provides a comprehensive fee schedule for the Planning & Development Department, which includes various plan check fees. This schedule, outlined in the 'PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FEE SCHEDULE' PDF, covers categories such as Site Planning Fees (including conceptual review, base review, and master plan review), Environmental Plan Review and Permit Fees (e.g., Hillside Development Review, Landscape Plan Review), Subdivision and Property Division Plan Review Fees, Civil Engineering Fees (including abandonment, plan review, and permit fees), and Building Safety Fees (including plan review and permit fees). Specific examples include: 

*   **Site Plan Conceptual Review Services:** Initial Meeting - $1,200, Follow-up Meeting - $600.
*   **Site Plan Base Review Services (Table C-1):** Commercial/Office - $5,200 base fee plus $360 per acre; Multi-Family Residential (3-25 Dwelling Units) - $2,500 base fee plus $40 per dwelling unit.
*   **Hillside Development Review:** Individual lots/commercial/industrial properties - $750 plus $16 per acre; Residential subdivisions - $1,500 plus $16 per acre.
*   **Preliminary Subdivision Plan Review:** Preliminary Plat - $2,500 base plus $40 per lot.
*   **Civil Engineering Basic Plan Review (Grading & Drainage, Paving, Concrete, & Fire Line):** First Office Review - $405 per sheet (24” X 36”).
*   **Building Safety Basic Plan Review (Residential with project valuation > $501):** 80% of the permit fee, minimum $150.
","The City of Phoenix Planning & Development Department Fee Schedule, which includes permit issuance fees, is available in a PDF document. This schedule is applicable city-wide and thus covers the South Mountain area of Phoenix. The fees are categorized under Site Planning, Environmental Plan Review, Subdivision and Property Division, Sign, Civil Engineering, and Building Safety. Specific fees vary by the type of permit and project. For example, a Hillside Permit costs $300. A Basic Sign Permit for a wall sign is $75 per sign, and a Grading and Drainage Permit can range from $100 for the first 100 cubic yards to over $3,432 for 100,001 cubic yards or more. The minimum permit fee for residential single lot construction is $150 and $300 for all other construction. 
","The City of Phoenix Planning & Development Department provides a comprehensive fee schedule for inspections. General inspection fees include:

*   **Re-inspection Fee for All Construction Permits:** $150 per re-inspection (charged for inspections called before work was ready, no access, or for failure to correct deficiencies).
*   **After-Hour Inspection Request:**
    *   Scheduled within 2 hours before or after current PDD inspection hours: $150 per inspector per hour, with a minimum of $300 per request (2-hours).
    *   Scheduled more than 2 hours before or after current PDD inspection hours, or any time on Saturdays, Sundays, or Holidays: $150 per inspector per hour, with a minimum of $450 per request (3-hours).
*   **Miscellaneous Inspection Services (Sign Permits):** $150 per hour, minimum $150 (1-hour).
*   **Environmental Preservation Inspection Permit for Single or Subdivided Property:** $150 per hour per site visit, minimum $300 (2-hours).
*   **Temporary Power Inspection Fee:** $150 each.
*   **Periodic Safety Inspections (Elevators, Dumbwaiters, Escalators, and Refrigeration Systems):** Fees vary based on the type of equipment and a per-hour or per-item charge.

There are no specific ""Foothills"" inspection fees; these rates apply city-wide.
","The City of Phoenix Foothills expedited review fees are calculated as three times the base fee for the specific type of plan submitted. An additional 20% of the expedited plan review fee will be assessed if a third review is necessary. The base fees are detailed in the 'Planning & Development Department Fee Schedule'.
","The City of Phoenix Planning & Development Department Fee Schedule indicates that for 'Plan Review of Corrections to Environmental Plans' and 'Plan Review of Corrections to Site Plans', a re-submittal which includes design changes unrelated to City-required corrections incurs a fee of 20% of the current plan review fee, with a minimum of $150 (1-hour). For the first correction (2nd review) where only required changes are made, there is no additional fee.
","The City of Phoenix charges $600 per request for a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy, valid for up to 180 days.
","The City of Phoenix demolition permit fees are as follows:

*   **Single-Family Residential Structure (including single-family accessory buildings):** $75
*   **All Structures Other than Single-Family:** $300 plus $6 per 1,000 sq. ft. or fraction thereof
","The City of Phoenix does not appear to have a separate, web-based schedule specifically for 'Foothills' water capacity fees. Instead, the general 'Development Occupational Fees' (DOF) schedule applies to properties within and outside the city limits, which covers the capital expansion of water and wastewater systems. These fees vary based on the type of residence (single-family, mobile home, multi-family) and whether the property is inside or outside city limits. Commercial and industrial fees are based on meter size and type, and location relative to city boundaries. For example, a single-family residence inside the city would have a water DOF of $600.00, while outside the city it would be $900.00. The water and sewer DOF fees are the same and are added together for the total DOF fee. 

Residential Fees:
* Single Family: $600.00 (Inside City), $900.00 (Outside City)
* Mobile Home Space: $420.00 (Inside City), $630.00 (Outside City)
* Apartment or Dwelling Unit in a Multiple Family Development: $360.00 (Inside City), $540.00 (Outside City)

Commercial and Industrial fees are based on water meter size and type, and location (inside/outside city). For instance, a 1"" disk meter inside the city is $1,500.00, and outside the city is $2,250.00. 

While general water rate schedules and impact fee schedules (some in PDF format) were found, none specifically detailed 'Foothills' water capacity fees as a distinct entity.
","The City of Phoenix's sewer capacity fees are referred to as 'Sewer residential development occupational fees.' The schedule for these fees is as follows:

*   **Single-family residence:** $600 per unit
*   **Mobile home space, trailer space, or recreational vehicle space:** $420 per space
*   **Apartment or dwelling unit in a multifamily development:** $360 per unit

These fees are imposed to cover costs associated with the connection of residential developments to the City's sanitary sewer system, addressing the increased burden on existing facilities and the need for future capital expansion.
","The City of Phoenix water transmission fees schedule, effective June 23, 2025, is available in the '2025 development impact fee update' document. This schedule outlines water transmission impact fees for various land use types and meter sizes. For example:

Water Transmission Fees (from the 'Water Transmission' section of the fee schedule):
- Single Family Unit - up to 1.0"": $5,127 (varying by area, e.g., Northwest Deer Valley)
- Single Family Unit - 1.5"": $11,177 (varying by area)
- Multifamily: $3,435 (varying by area)
- 3/4 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $6,691 (varying by area)

- 2 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $33,569 (varying by area)
- 3 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $104,860 (varying by area)
- 4 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $184,572 (varying by area)
- 6 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $293,585 (varying by area)
- 8 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $587,285 (varying by area)
- 10 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $1,153,575 (varying by area)
- 12 Inch (Non-Residential) Meter: $1,153,575 (varying by area)

Specific fees vary by the service area within the City of Phoenix, with columns for areas like 'Northwest Deer Valley', 'Northeast Paradise Ridge', 'Estrella North', 'Estrella South', 'Laveen East', 'Laveen West', and 'Ahwatukee'. A distinct 'Foothills' water transmission fee schedule was not explicitly identified as a separate category within this document; the provided fees are general for the City of Phoenix and its designated impact fee service areas.
","The City of Phoenix Foothills sewer transmission fees are detailed in the 'Sewer Service Charges By User Category' schedule, effective July 1, 2025. This document outlines various sewer flow, monthly minimum, user, other, and total charges, broken down by user code and category (e.g., 1 Family Residence, Commercial Units, Governments, Schools, etc.). It also includes charges for services with and without dining facilities and environmental charges. For example, a 1 Family Residence (User Code 1) has a Monthly Minimum Charge of $4.50, a Sewer User Charge of $1.4306, an Other Charge of $1.5629, and a Total Monthly Charge of $2.9935 (these are per CCF, with an 80% Sewer Flow percentage).

An account balance greater than $25 from replacement fees will block borrowing privileges.
","The City of Phoenix does not have a specific 'school impact fees' web-based schedule because public schools, school districts, and charter schools are exempt from impact fees, as stated in Sections 9-500.18 and 15-189.01 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, referenced in Phoenix City Code Chapter 29-4. General Development Impact Fees for 'Public' land use, which would apply to public facilities including schools if not exempt, are outlined in the 'Development Impact & Water Resources Acquisition Fee Schedules' effective June 23, 2025.
","The City of Phoenix does not appear to have a single, consolidated 'Foothills general government fees web-based schedule.' Instead, fees are categorized by department and service, such as Planning & Development, which includes Development, Zoning, and Impact Fees. The Foothills area is identified as a Village Planning Committee area (Ahwatukee Foothills), and any applicable fees for development or services within this area would fall under the general city-wide fee schedules. The relevant fee schedules are:

*   **Development Fee Schedule (effective March 1, 2010)**: This document covers fees related to site planning, environmental plan review, subdivision, civil engineering, and building safety.
*   **Zoning Fee Schedule (Revised January 10, 2023)**: This document outlines fees for zoning amendments, hillside density waivers, written certification of zoning, promotional event permits, and special permits.
