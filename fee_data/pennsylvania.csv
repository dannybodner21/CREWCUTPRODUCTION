This rate is determined by the PWD through an analysis of available pipe capacity within the specific sewershed where a project is located. It dictates a maximum stormwater release rate (cubic feet per second per acre) for certain storm events and varies depending on the project's sewer connection(s). This mechanism represents the development and application of sewer capacity fees in Philadelphia, designed to manage the impact of development on the existing sewer infrastructure and address public health and safety concerns related to sewer capacity limitations. Official documents, such as the 'Formal Notice of Proposed Changes in Rates and Charges' from the Philadelphia Water Department, confirm the review and implementation of these capacity charges.","The Philadelphia Water Department has proposed new rates and charges effective September 1, 2025. Water charges will consist of a monthly service charge and a quantity charge, which includes a Tiered Assistance Program (TAP) Rate Rider Surcharge. For general customers, monthly water service charges vary by meter size, ranging from $6.08 for a 5/8"" meter to $503.58 for a 12"" meter. The monthly water quantity charges per Mcf (thousand cubic feet) are tiered: $76.32 for the first 2 Mcf, $68.63 for the next 98 Mcf, and $54.03 for usage over 100 Mcf. Sewer charges, also effective September 1, 2025, will similarly have a monthly service charge (ranging from $8.22 for a 5/8"" meter to $1059.17 for a 12"" meter) and a quantity charge of $53.06 per Mcf, which includes a TAP-R Surcharge.

The new base fare for Bus and Metro trips will be $2.90. This development is a consequence of a $213 million budget deficit and a lack of state funding, which has also led to planned service reductions of 45%.","Philadelphia Parks & Recreation fees are developed in part through 'public dedication' or 'fees-in-lieu' from real estate developers in Pennsylvania municipalities, including Philadelphia. Municipalities can require developers to dedicate land for park and recreation purposes or, at the municipality's discretion, allow developers to pay a fee, construct recreational facilities, or privately reserve land for such purposes. To implement such a system, the municipality must: 1. Adopt a formally adopted recreation plan that justifies the dedication standard. 2. Incorporate the dedication requirement into its subdivision and land development ordinance with definite standards for determining the proportion of land to be dedicated or the amount of any fee. The collected land or fees must be used solely for providing, acquiring, operating, or maintaining park or recreational facilities that are reasonably accessible to the development from which they were obtained. Fees collected must be deposited in an interest-bearing account specifically reserved for these purposes and are refundable if used for other purposes.","The Philadelphia Development Impact Tax (Chapter 19-4400 of The Philadelphia Code) is levied on new residential construction and improvements. The proceeds of this tax are appropriated to the Department of Planning and Development – Division of Housing and Community Development and are deposited into the Non-Recording Fee Sub-fund of the Housing Trust Fund. The funds are designated for housing-related purposes, including workforce development, construction training, affordable housing preservation, and assistance for renters, small landlords, and homeowners.

The city's Realty Transfer Tax rate increased to 3.578% and then to 4.578% effective July 1, 2025. The rental license fee increased from $63 to $69 per unit. Document recording fees at the Philadelphia Department of Records increased by $3, effective July 1, 2025.","In Philadelphia, storm drainage fees are assessed monthly on all properties to recover costs for stormwater management. The fee calculation varies by property type: Residential properties are charged a flat fee based on the average property size and impervious area across the city. Non-residential and condominium properties are charged based on the specific square footage of their gross area and impervious area, with rates per 500 square feet for each. The Philadelphia Water Department offers several incentives to property owners and developers to encourage stormwater management, which can lead to lower costs: Stormwater Credits: For non-residential property owners to reduce their monthly stormwater bill by incorporating beneficial stormwater management techniques. Stormwater Grants: For non-residential private property owners to design and build stormwater retrofit projects, making them eligible for Stormwater Credits. Rain Check: For residential property owners, offering free or discounted rain barrels, planters, and other stormwater management practices. Development Incentives: Specifically for projects undergoing development and redevelopment, such as the Developer ROW Incentive, which may offer lump sums or zoning allowances/exceptions for managing additional stormwater area.","The development of Philadelphia water meter fees is determined through a transparent process involving public hearings by the Philadelphia Water, Sewer, and Storm Water Rate Board. The Philadelphia Water Department files advance notices of proposed changes to its general rates and charges, which include a service charge for water meters (e.g., 5/8"" meter). Recent rate changes became effective on September 1, 2024, and proposed changes are expected to be effective on September 1, 2025, and September 1, 2026. The Rate Board issues a rate determination after these proceedings.","The basic sewer connection fee in Philadelphia starts at $265 and increases based on the size of the connection.

Quantity Charges (per Mcf - 1 Mcf = 1,000 cubic feet = 7,480 gallons): These charges include a base charge and a Tiered Assistance Program (TAP) Rate Rider Surcharge (TAP-R). First 2 Mcf (0 to 2 Mcf): Base Charge $64.32/Mcf + TAP-R $3.08/Mcf = Total $67.40/Mcf. Next 98 Mcf (2.1 to 100 Mcf): Base Charge $57.88/Mcf + TAP-R $3.08/Mcf = Total $60.96/Mcf. Next 1,900 Mcf (100.1 to 2,000 Mcf): Base Charge $44.84/Mcf + TAP-R $3.08/Mcf = Total $47.92/Mcf. Over 2,000 Mcf: Base Charge $43.62/Mcf + TAP-R $3.08/Mcf = Total $46.70/Mcf. The TAP-R is calculated and reconciled annually to reflect changes in TAP costs, apportioned at 42% for water and fire service and 58% for wastewater.","As of the current information available, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and the Water, Sewer & Storm Water Rate Board do not publicly list specific, separate fees for 'reclaimed water.' Philadelphia actively develops and promotes the use of reclaimed water for non-potable applications, such as toilet flushing and industrial use, as part of its broader stormwater management and water conservation efforts. However, the costs associated with reclaimed water are not itemized as distinct 'reclaimed water fees' but rather appear to be integrated into the general water, wastewater, and stormwater rates set by the independent Water, Sewer, and Storm Water Rate Board.","The Philadelphia Water Department's 'Rates and Charges' document (effective September 1, 2024) outlines the following relevant fees for development: Water Connection Charges (Section 6.7): Ferrule Connections (3/4"" to 2""): Charges range from $190 to $335 during regular business hours, and $215 to $360 during non-regular business hours.

The Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) also introduced new stormwater management practice (SMP) maintenance guidance and a developer Right-of-Way (ROW) incentive.","In Philadelphia, there are no explicitly stated 'private street fees' for development. Instead, developers undertaking private paving of existing streets or construction of new streets that will eventually be maintained by the City must go through a process that involves a 'work proposal' based on City replacement costs. The value of this proposal dictates the amounts for required bonds, including Labor & Materialmen, Performance, Compensation Affidavit, and Maintenance Bonds. There may also be fees for the review of ADA ramp plans.","For development planning plan reviews by the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, there are no separate costs. However, there is an in-lieu fee of $1,000 for every required parking lot tree not planted under Philadelphia's new landscape ordinance.

Instead, developers in Philadelphia are subject to a Development Impact Tax, which is a 1% tax on construction or improvement costs for residential new construction over $15,000. This is a general development tax and not specifically tied to traffic studies. In Pennsylvania, Transportation Impact Fees are a funding mechanism permitted by the state's Municipalities Planning Code. These fees can be assessed to new development in proportion to its impact on transportation and can include planning costs such as traffic studies. The process to develop and calculate these fees is often referred to as an ""Act 209 study,"" and municipalities need to enact their own impact fee ordinances to collect them. While several townships in Pennsylvania have adopted such ordinances, explicit evidence of Philadelphia having its own specific transportation impact fee ordinance that outlines dedicated traffic study fees or their development was not found in the search results. Therefore, while traffic studies are a component of development, and there are general development taxes in Philadelphia, there is no readily available information on a specific ""Philadelphia traffic study fee"" or a dedicated ordinance outlining its development within the city.",There are no archaeological fees for development in Philadelphia; the project review by the Philadelphia Historical Commission or its staff is free of charge.,"Specific, standardized fees for biological surveys related to development in Philadelphia are not publicly available. Environmental consulting firms in Philadelphia, such as SWCA Environmental Consultants, offer biological and ecological services. It is typical for these services to be quoted on a project-by-project basis. Cost components for biological assessments generally include hourly rates for labor (e.g., around $80/hour based on a non-Philadelphia specific estimate), overheads, and administrative fees. Other related environmental assessments, such as a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, can range from $1,700 to $2,500. A convenience charge of $40 is associated with PNDI (Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory) receipts for environmental review.","The City of Philadelphia assesses a Right-of-Way (ROW) Registration fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500). The Department of Streets is authorized to establish and adjust both ROW Registration fees and permit fees through regulations to recover the costs of administering and maintaining the GPIS system, and for issuing, administering, and enforcing Street Opening and Street Closure Permits.","For Fiscal Year 2025, the City of Philadelphia's Streets Department plans to implement a new method for collecting Right-of-Way (ROW) management fees, which are essentially street cut fees. These fees will be collected at the time of permit issuance and will be based on a per linear foot of street opening for each permit. This development is in response to recent court cases concerning local imposition of management fees. The re-implementation of these fees, after several years of non-collection, is projected to add additional right-of-way management revenues.","The fee for all traffic signal drawings in Philadelphia is $10 per intersection. The city is also undergoing various traffic signal development and modernization efforts, including investments in traffic safety, signal retiming, and upgrades to existing traffic signal technology at approximately 40 intersections.",The development of street lighting fees in Philadelphia involves a new 'smart' street lighting tariff (SL-C rate) introduced by Peco. This tariff reduces the fixed 'location charge' for each streetlight while increasing the per-kilowatt charge for energy consumption. The city anticipates that the energy savings from the conversion to LED streetlights will offset the higher per-kilowatt cost.,"In Philadelphia, there are established regulations and fees related to sidewalks.
