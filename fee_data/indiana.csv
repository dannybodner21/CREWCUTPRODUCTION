There are two main types of assessments: Capital Assessments: These are one-time levies for specific improvement projects, often related to construction. Variable Rate Assessments: These represent annual cost shares assigned to a property for ongoing services or improvements provided by the County, such as street lighting, landscape and lake management, and security guards.","Miami-Dade County utilizes Special Assessment Districts to fund localized improvements and services beneficial to specific properties, often initiated by developers during project inception.
