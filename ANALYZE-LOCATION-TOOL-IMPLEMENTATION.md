# Tool 2: analyzeLocation - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented location intelligence tool for LEWIS that analyzes development sites and finds nearby amenities using **FREE OpenStreetMap APIs** (no API keys needed).

## What It Does

Analyzes any address and returns:
- **Nearby amenities** (grocery stores, transit, schools, parks, restaurants, healthcare)
- **Walkability score** (0-100)
- **Location insights** (transit access, grocery access, family-friendliness)
- **Overall assessment** (excellent/good/moderate for residential development)

## Files Modified

### 1. Tool Definition
**File:** `src/tools/custom-api-tool/index.ts` (lines 347-369)
- Added `analyzeLocation` tool
- Parameters: `address`, `jurisdiction`, optional `radius` (default 1 mile)
- Triggers on: "what's near my site?", "location analysis", "nearby amenities"

### 2. API Handler
**File:** `src/app/api/lewis/route.ts` (lines 569-736)
- **Geocoding:** Uses Nominatim API to convert address ‚Üí coordinates
- **Amenity Search:** Uses Overpass API to find places within radius
- **6 Amenity Categories:**
  - Grocery Stores (`shop=supermarket`)
  - Schools (`amenity=school`)
  - Parks (`leisure=park`)
  - Restaurants (`amenity=restaurant`)
  - Healthcare (`amenity=hospital`)
  - Transit Stations (`public_transport=station`)
- **Rate Limiting:** 200ms delay between Overpass requests (API requirement)
- **Distance Calculation:** Haversine formula for accurate distances

### 3. Client Implementation
**File:** `src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts` (lines 993-1070)
- Calls API endpoint
- Formats response with amenities grouped by category
- Shows walkability score and insights
- Suggests next steps

### 4. Interface Registration
**Files:**
- `src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts:141` - Added to CustomApiToolAction interface
- `src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts:40` - Added to BuiltinToolAction interface
- `src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts:88` - Mapped to customApiActions

### 5. System Prompt
**File:** `packages/const/src/settings/lewis-agent.ts`
- Added Rule #6 for analyzeLocation (lines 133-144)
- Added to NEW CAPABILITIES section (lines 158-167)
- Updated tools list (line 441)

## APIs Used (100% FREE)

### 1. Nominatim (Geocoding)
- **URL:** `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search`
- **Purpose:** Convert address ‚Üí latitude/longitude
- **Requirements:** Must include User-Agent header (‚úÖ included as "LEWIS-Construction-Portal/1.0")
- **Rate Limit:** 1 request/second (we only make 1 request per analyzeLocation call)

### 2. Overpass API (POI Search)
- **URL:** `https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter`
- **Purpose:** Find nearby points of interest
- **Requirements:** 200ms delay between requests (‚úÖ included)
- **Rate Limit:** Fair use (we make 6 requests total, spaced 200ms apart)

## How It Works

1. **User provides address:** "What's near 123 Main St, Phoenix, AZ?"

2. **LEWIS calls analyzeLocation:**
   ```typescript
   analyzeLocation({
     address: "123 Main St, Phoenix, AZ",
     jurisdiction: "Phoenix",
     radius: 1  // default
   })
   ```

3. **API geocodes address:**
   - Nominatim: "123 Main St, Phoenix, AZ" ‚Üí (33.4484, -112.0740)

4. **API searches for amenities:**
   - For each category (6 total):
     - Query Overpass API for places within 1 mile (1609.34 meters)
     - Calculate distances from site
     - Sort by distance, take top 3
     - Wait 200ms before next query

5. **API calculates insights:**
   - Walkability score = min(100, totalAmenities * 5)
   - Grocery access: 2+ stores = excellent, 1 = limited, 0 = car-dependent
   - Transit access: 1+ stations = good, 0 = limited
   - Schools: 2+ = family-oriented
   - Parks: 2+ = family-friendly

6. **Returns formatted response:**
   ```
   I'll analyze the location at 123 Main St, Phoenix, AZ.

   **Nearby Amenities (within 1 mile):**

   **Grocery Stores:**
   - Safeway - 0.3 miles away
   - Whole Foods - 0.6 miles away

   **Transit Stations:**
   - Central Station - 0.4 miles away

   **Schools:**
   - Phoenix Elementary - 0.5 miles away
   - Lincoln Middle School - 0.8 miles away

   **Parks:**
   - Central Park - 0.2 miles away

   **Walkability Score:** 65/100

   **Location Insights:**
   - 2 grocery stores within 1 mile provides excellent access for residents
   - Good transit access with 1 station nearby
   - 2 schools nearby supports family-oriented development
   - 1 park nearby enhances appeal to families

   **Overall:** ‚úÖ This location is **good** for residential development.

## Testing

### Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server
Ctrl+C

# Delete build cache
rm -rf .next

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### Test Queries

**Basic location analysis:**
```
"What's near 123 E Washington St, Phoenix, AZ?"
"Analyze the location at 701 Congress Ave, Austin, TX"
"Find amenities near 1801 California St, Denver, CO"
```

**With custom radius:**
```
"What's within 2 miles of 123 Main St, Phoenix?"
"Find amenities within half a mile of my Austin site at [address]"
```

### Expected Console Output
```
üìç LEWIS TOOL: analyzeLocation called with: {address: "...", jurisdiction: "...", radius: 1}
üìç LEWIS TOOL: Response status: 200
üìç LEWIS TOOL: analyzeLocation API result: {...}
üìå Coordinates: 33.4484, -112.0740
```

- 50-69:  "good"
- 0-49:   "moderate"
```

## Integration with Other Tools

**Workflow example:**
```
User: "What's near 123 Main St, Phoenix?"
LEWIS: [calls analyzeLocation, shows results]

User: "Great, what should I build there?"
LEWIS: [calls optimizeProject with Phoenix jurisdiction]

User: "Compare those fees to Denver"
LEWIS: [calls compareCities with Phoenix and Denver]
```

## Limitations

1. **Data Quality:** Depends on OpenStreetMap community updates
2. **Coverage:** Better in urban areas than rural
3. **Rate Limits:**
   - Nominatim: 1 req/sec (we make 1)
   - Overpass: Fair use (we make 6 with 200ms delays)
4. **Timeout:** Overpass queries timeout after 25 seconds
5. **Result Limit:** Top 3 per category (by design)

## Error Handling

**Address not found:**
```
"Could not find location. Please provide a valid address."
```

**API errors:**
```
"I encountered an error analyzing the location: [error message].
Please provide a valid address (e.g., '123 Main St, Phoenix, AZ')."
```
