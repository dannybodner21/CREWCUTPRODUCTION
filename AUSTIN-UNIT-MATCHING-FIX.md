# AUSTIN TRANSPORTATION FEE UNIT MATCHING - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem
Austin Transportation User Fees for Duplex, Triplex, Fourplex, Garage Apartment, and Mobile Home were all matching a 10-unit Multi-Family project incorrectly.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing subtypes**: Transportation fees had no `use_subtypes` set
2. **No unit count validation**: Fee matching didn't check if project unit count matched fee requirements

## Solution

### 1. Database Updates - Set Proper Subtypes

**Single-Family only:**
```
Transportation User Fee - Garage Apartment → use_subtypes: ['single-family']
Transportation User Fee - Mobile Home → use_subtypes: ['single-family']
```

**Small Multi-Family (exact unit count):**
```
Transportation User Fee - Duplex → use_subtypes: ['duplex']
Transportation User Fee - Triplex → use_subtypes: ['triplex']
Transportation User Fee - Fourplex → use_subtypes: ['fourplex']
```

**Regular Multi-Family (5+ units):**
```
Transportation User Fee - Townhouse/Condominium → use_subtypes: ['multifamily']
```

### 2. Code Updates - Unit Count Validation

**Updated `feeAppliesToProject()` in `/src/lib/fee-calculator/index.ts`:**

Added unit count checking (lines 1303-1338):
```typescript
// CHECK UNIT COUNT for specific subtypes
if (useSubtypes && useSubtypes.length > 0 && numUnits > 0) {
    for (const subtype of useSubtypes) {
        const sub = subtype.toLowerCase();

        // Duplex = exactly 2 units
        if (sub === 'duplex' && numUnits !== 2) {
            console.log(`   ❌ Duplex fee requires 2 units, project has ${numUnits}`);
            return false;
        }

        // Triplex = exactly 3 units
        if (sub === 'triplex' && numUnits !== 3) {
            console.log(`   ❌ Triplex fee requires 3 units, project has ${numUnits}`);
            return false;
        }

        // Fourplex = exactly 4 units
        if (sub === 'fourplex' && numUnits !== 4) {
            console.log(`   ❌ Fourplex fee requires 4 units, project has ${numUnits}`);
            return false;
        }

        // Single-family = 1 unit only
        if (sub === 'single-family' && numUnits > 1) {
            console.log(`   ❌ Single-family fee requires 1 unit, project has ${numUnits}`);
            return false;
        }

        // Multifamily = 5+ units
        if (sub === 'multifamily' && numUnits > 0 && numUnits < 5) {
            console.log(`   ❌ Multifamily fee requires 5+ units, project has ${numUnits}`);
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

Added subtype recognition for duplex/triplex/fourplex (line 1402):
```typescript
if (isMultiFamily) {
    // Match multifamily, duplex, triplex, fourplex for multi-family projects
    if (sub.includes('multi') || sub === 'duplex' || sub === 'triplex' || sub === 'fourplex') {
        subtypeMatches = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

## Test Results

### Test 1: 10-unit Multi-Family Project
```
✅ Transportation User Fees: 1
   - Transportation User Fee - Townhouse/Condominium: $16.35

✅ Correctly EXCLUDES:
   - Duplex (requires 2 units)
   - Triplex (requires 3 units)
   - Fourplex (requires 4 units)
   - Garage Apartment (single-family)
   - Mobile Home (single-family)
```

### Test 2: 2-unit Duplex Project
```
✅ Transportation User Fees: 1
   - Transportation User Fee - Duplex: $16.34

✅ Correctly EXCLUDES:
   - Triplex (requires 3 units)
   - Fourplex (requires 4 units)
   - Townhouse/Condo (requires 5+ units)
```

### Test 3: 3-unit Triplex Project
```
✅ Transportation User Fees: 1
   - Transportation User Fee - Triplex: $16.34

✅ Correctly EXCLUDES:
   - Duplex (requires 2 units)
   - Fourplex (requires 4 units)
   - Townhouse/Condo (requires 5+ units)
```

## Files Modified

1. **Database (via fix-austin-subtypes.ts)**
   - Updated 7 Austin Transportation User Fee records with proper `use_subtypes`

2. **`/src/lib/fee-calculator/index.ts`**
   - Line 1288: Updated `feeAppliesToProject()` signature to accept `numUnits` parameter
   - Lines 1303-1338: Added unit count validation logic
   - Line 1402: Added duplex/triplex/fourplex as valid subtypes for multi-family
   - Line 550: Updated call site to pass `inputs.numUnits`

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Only fees matching exact unit count requirements are included
2. **Compliance**: Ensures correct fee calculations for different project sizes
3. **Transparency**: Console logs show why fees are included/excluded based on unit count
4. **Flexibility**: System now handles graduated multi-family definitions (2-4 units vs 5+ units)

## Verification

Run the test:
```bash
npx tsx test-austin-unit-matching.ts
```

Expected results:
- 10-unit project: Only Townhouse/Condo fee
- 2-unit project: Only Duplex fee
- 3-unit project: Only Triplex fee
- 4-unit project: Only Fourplex fee
- 5+ unit project: Only Townhouse/Condo fee

✅ **AUSTIN TRANSPORTATION FEE UNIT MATCHING IS NOW WORKING CORRECTLY**
