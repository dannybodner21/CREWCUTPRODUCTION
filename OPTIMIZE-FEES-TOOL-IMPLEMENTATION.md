# Tool 3: optimizeFees - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented fee optimization tool for LEWIS that analyzes projects and suggests strategies to reduce development costs.

## What It Does

Analyzes a development project and returns:
- **Baseline fees** (current total)
- **Optimization strategies** ranked by savings potential
- **Feasibility assessment** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Trade-offs** for each strategy
- **Total potential savings**
- **General recommendations**

## Files Modified

### 1. Tool Definition
**File:** `src/tools/custom-api-tool/index.ts` (lines 370-400)
- Added `optimizeFees` tool
- Parameters: `jurisdiction`, `projectType`, `units`, `squareFeet`, optional `currentServiceArea`
- Triggers on: "how to reduce fees", "lower costs", "fee optimization", "save money on fees"

### 2. API Handler
**File:** `src/app/api/lewis/route.ts` (lines 773-959)
- Calculates baseline fees using FeeCalculator
- **Tests 3 optimization strategies:**

  **Strategy 1: Smaller Water Meter** (for projects ≤10 units)
  - Tests 5/8" meter instead of 3/4"
  - Shows actual savings if applicable

  **Strategy 2: Phased Development** (for projects ≥50 units)
  - Breaks project into 2 phases
  - Analyzes cash flow benefits

  **Strategy 3: Reduce Unit Size** (Multi-Family only)
  - Targets 800 sq ft/unit if current average is higher
  - Calculates fee savings from reduced square footage

- Sorts strategies by savings amount
- Provides general recommendations

### 3. Client Implementation
**File:** `src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts` (lines 1084-1191)
- Calls API endpoint
- Formats response with strategies ranked by savings
- Shows percentage reduction for each strategy
- Displays total potential savings

### 4. Interface Registration
**Files:**
- `src/tools/custom-api-tool/actions.ts:142` - Added to CustomApiToolAction interface
- `src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts:41` - Added to BuiltinToolAction interface
- `src/store/tool/slices/builtin/action.ts:90` - Mapped to customApiActions

### 5. System Prompt
**File:** `packages/const/src/settings/lewis-agent.ts`
- Added Rule #7 for optimizeFees (lines 146-157)
- Added to NEW CAPABILITIES section (lines 182-192)
- Updated tools list (line 476)

## Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Smaller Water Meter
**When:** Projects with ≤10 units
**Action:** Switch from 3/4" to 5/8" meter
**Typical Savings:** $5,000 - $20,000
**Feasibility:** High
**Trade-off:** May limit future water capacity

### Strategy 2: Phased Development
**When:** Projects with ≥50 units
**Action:** Break into 2 phases
**Benefit:** Spreads costs over time, improves cash flow
**Feasibility:** Medium (requires phased permitting)
**Trade-off:** Longer timeline

### Strategy 3: Reduce Unit Size
**When:** Multi-Family projects with >800 sq ft/unit average
**Action:** Target 800 sq ft/unit
**Typical Savings:** Varies by jurisdiction
**Feasibility:** Medium (market dependent)
**Trade-off:** Smaller units may limit rental/sale prices

## General Recommendations

The tool also provides recommendations:
- Review fee schedule for exemptions/waivers
- Consider timing (annual fee adjustments)
- Negotiate phased payment plans
- For $1M+ in fees: hire fee consultant

## Testing

### Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Clean rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Test Queries

```
"How can I reduce fees for my 100-unit multifamily project in Austin?"
"Ways to lower development costs for 50 units in Phoenix"
"Optimize fees for my Denver project: 75 units, 63,750 sq ft"
"Can I save money on development fees in Los Angeles?"
```

### Expected Response

```
I'll analyze fee optimization strategies for your 100-unit Multi-Family project in Austin.

**Current Development Fees:** `$1,234,567`

**Fee Reduction Strategies:**

**1. Reduce average unit size to 800 sq ft (from 900 sq ft)**
   • Potential Savings: `$123,456` (10.0% reduction)
   • New Total: `$1,111,111`
   • Feasibility: Medium - market dependent
   • Trade-off: Smaller units may limit rental/sale prices

**2. Break into 2 phases (50 units per phase)**
   • Benefit: Cash flow benefit
   • New Total: `$1,200,000`
   • Feasibility: Medium - requires phased permitting
   • Trade-off: Longer timeline, but better cash flow management

**Total Potential Savings:** `$123,456` (10.0% reduction)

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Review jurisdiction's fee schedule for any available exemptions or waivers
- Consider timing: Some jurisdictions adjust fees annually, plan accordingly
- Negotiate with jurisdiction on phased payment plans for large projects
- For projects over $1M in fees, consider hiring a fee consultant

Would you like me to recalculate fees with any of these optimizations applied?
```

## How It Works

1. **User asks about fee reduction:**
   ```
   "How can I reduce fees for my 100-unit Austin project?"
   ```

2. **LEWIS calls optimizeFees:**
   ```typescript
   optimizeFees({
     jurisdiction: "Austin",
     projectType: "Multi-Family",
     units: 100,
     squareFeet: 85000
   })
   ```

3. **API calculates baseline:**
   - Uses FeeCalculator with current parameters
   - Gets total one-time fees

4. **API tests optimization strategies:**
   - **If units ≤10:** Test smaller meter (5/8" vs 3/4")
   - **If units ≥50:** Test phased development
   - **If Multi-Family with large units:** Test reducing to 800 sq ft/unit

5. **API sorts and ranks:**
   - Strategies sorted by savings amount (descending)
   - Calculates total potential savings

6. **Returns formatted response:**
   - Baseline fees
   - Ranked strategies with % reduction
   - Feasibility and trade-offs
   - General recommendations

## Features

✅ **Data-Driven** - Real fee calculations for each strategy
✅ **Ranked Results** - Sorted by savings potential
✅ **Feasibility Assessment** - High/Medium/Low ratings
✅ **Trade-off Analysis** - Clear explanation of downsides
✅ **Actionable** - Specific recommendations
✅ **Context-Aware** - Different strategies for different project sizes

## Use Cases

### Small Project (≤10 units)
**Strategies offered:**
- Smaller water meter
- General recommendations

### Medium Project (11-49 units)
**Strategies offered:**
- Reduce unit size (if applicable)
- General recommendations

### Large Project (≥50 units)
**Strategies offered:**
- Phased development
- Reduce unit size (if applicable)
- General recommendations
- Fee consultant recommendation (if >$1M)

## Integration with Other Tools

**Common workflow:**

```
User: "Compare Austin vs Denver for 100 units"
LEWIS: [calls compareCities, shows Austin is cheaper]

User: "How can I reduce the Austin fees?"
LEWIS: [calls optimizeFees for Austin project]

User: "Recalculate with smaller units"
LEWIS: [calls calculateFees with 800 sq ft/unit]
```

## Limitations

1. **Strategy Testing:** Only tests specific strategies, not all possible combinations
2. **Cost Estimates:** Construction cost implications not included
3. **Market Analysis:** Doesn't assess market demand for smaller units
4. **Jurisdiction Rules:** Doesn't account for specific zoning/permitting constraints
5. **Service Areas:** Doesn't yet test different service area options

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Test different service areas (if multiple available)
- Analyze affordable housing incentives
- Calculate ROI impact of each strategy
- Include timeline analysis
- Test different meter sizes (not just 5/8" and 3/4")

## Error Handling

**Jurisdiction not found:**
```
"Jurisdiction not found"
```

**No strategies available:**
```
"No specific optimization strategies found for this project configuration."
```

**API errors:**
```
"I encountered an error optimizing fees: [error message]"
```
