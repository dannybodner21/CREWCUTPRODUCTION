# Feasibility Report Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### Issue #1: Project Specifications Section Showing All N/A
**Problem:** Page 5 "Project Specifications" section was blank, showing all N/A

**Root Cause:**
- Original code used conditional `if` statements to only show fields when values existed
- When values were missing, the entire field was omitted, creating a sparse/blank section
- No dedicated "Project Specifications" section header

**Fix Applied:**
**File:** `src/lib/fee-calculator/index.ts` (lines 1856-1867)

**Changes:**
1. Created dedicated "PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS" section with header
2. Always display ALL fields with fallback to "N/A" when values missing
3. Added proper formatting with units (sq ft, $, etc.)

**Code:**
```typescript
// Project Specifications Section - always show all fields
report += '‚îÄ'.repeat(70) + '\n';
report += 'PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS\n';
report += '‚îÄ'.repeat(70) + '\n';
report += `  Project Type:     ${breakdown.project.projectType || 'Not specified'}\n`;
report += `  Use Subtype:      ${breakdown.project.useSubtype || 'Not specified'}\n`;
report += `  Jurisdiction:     ${breakdown.project.jurisdictionName}, ${breakdown.project.stateCode}\n`;
report += `  Service Area:     ${breakdown.project.serviceArea || 'Citywide'}\n`;
report += `  Number of Units:  ${breakdown.project.numUnits || 'N/A'}\n`;
report += `  Square Footage:   ${breakdown.project.squareFeet ? breakdown.project.squareFeet.toLocaleString() + ' sq ft' : 'N/A'}\n`;
report += `  Project Value:    ${breakdown.project.projectValue ? '$' + breakdown.project.projectValue.toLocaleString() : 'N/A'}\n`;
report += `  Meter Size:       ${breakdown.project.meterSize || 'N/A'}\n`;
```

**Result:** Project Specifications section now always shows complete structure with all fields ‚úÖ

### Issue #2: Exclusions Section Incorrect
**Problem:** Report said "Does not include: building permit fees, plan review fees, or inspection fees" but these ARE included in the calculation

**Root Cause:**
- Static text in "Important Notes" section
- Did not dynamically check what was actually included vs. excluded
- Misleading to users reading the report

**Fix Applied:**
**File:** `src/lib/fee-calculator/index.ts` (lines 1923-1970)

**Changes:**
1. Dynamically check what fees are actually included in the calculation
2. Created two sections: "What This Report Includes" and "What This Report Does NOT Include"
3. Only show items that are truly excluded

**Code:**
```typescript
// Determine what's actually excluded
const hasPermitFees = breakdown.fees.some(f =>
    f.feeName.toLowerCase().includes('permit') ||
    f.feeName.toLowerCase().includes('plan review') ||
    f.feeName.toLowerCase().includes('inspection')
);
const hasImpactFees = breakdown.fees.some(f =>
    f.category?.toLowerCase().includes('impact') ||
    f.feeName.toLowerCase().includes('impact fee')
);

report += 'What This Report Includes:\n';
if (hasImpactFees) report += '  ‚úì Impact fees (water, sewer, transportation, parks, etc.)\n';
if (hasPermitFees) report += '  ‚úì Building permits, plan review, and inspection fees\n';
report += '  ‚úì Connection and tap fees\n';
report += '  ‚úì Monthly utility base charges and volume rates\n';
report += '  ‚úì System development charges (SDCs)\n\n';

report += 'What This Report Does NOT Include:\n';
report += '  ‚úó Development agreement fees or negotiations\n';
report += '  ‚úó Off-site infrastructure improvements\n';
report += '  ‚úó Annexation fees (if applicable)\n';
report += '  ‚úó Environmental review or mitigation fees\n';
report += '  ‚úó HOA or special district assessments\n';
report += '  ‚úó Utility connection construction costs\n\n';
```

**Result:** Report now accurately shows what's included vs. excluded based on actual calculation ‚úÖ

### Issue #3: Missing Decision-Making Context
**Problem:** Report was "just a data dump" without context for decision-making

**User's explicit request:** "Add per-unit breakdown, fee timeline, inflation projections, usage assumptions"

**Fix Applied:**
**File:** `src/lib/fee-calculator/index.ts` (lines 1879-1889, 1938-1977)

**Changes Added:**

#### 3a. Per-Unit Breakdown
```typescript
// Per-unit breakdown (if applicable)
if (breakdown.project.numUnits && breakdown.project.numUnits > 0) {
    report += '\n' + '‚îÄ'.repeat(70) + '\n';
    report += 'PER-UNIT BREAKDOWN\n';
    report += '‚îÄ'.repeat(70) + '\n';
    report += `  Development Cost per Unit:  $${(breakdown.oneTimeFees / breakdown.project.numUnits).toLocaleString()}\n`;
    report += `  Monthly Cost per Unit:      $${(breakdown.monthlyFees / breakdown.project.numUnits).toLocaleString()}\n`;
    report += `  Annual Cost per Unit:       $${(breakdown.annualOperatingCosts / breakdown.project.numUnits).toLocaleString()}\n`;
    report += `  First Year Total per Unit:  $${(breakdown.firstYearTotal / breakdown.project.numUnits).toLocaleString()}\n`;
}
```

#### 3b. Fee Timeline
```typescript
report += 'Fee Timeline:\n';
report += '  ‚Ä¢ Impact fees and connection fees: Due at building permit issuance\n';
report += '  ‚Ä¢ Monthly operating costs: Begin at certificate of occupancy\n';
report += '  ‚Ä¢ Annual increases: Fees typically increase 2-5% annually\n\n';
```

#### 3c. Usage Assumptions
```typescript
report += 'Usage Assumptions:\n';
report += '  ‚Ä¢ Water consumption: Based on meter size and typical usage patterns\n';
report += '  ‚Ä¢ Sewer flows: Calculated from water usage (typically 85-95% of water)\n';
report += '  ‚Ä¢ Monthly volume charges: Shown as annual average (varies seasonally)\n';
report += '  ‚Ä¢ Peak demand charges: Applied where applicable based on meter size\n\n';
```

#### 3d. Multi-Year Projections with Inflation
```typescript
report += 'Multi-Year Projections (with 3% annual inflation):\n';
const year2Total = breakdown.annualOperatingCosts * 1.03;
const year3Total = breakdown.annualOperatingCosts * 1.03 * 1.03;
const year5Total = breakdown.annualOperatingCosts * Math.pow(1.03, 4);
report += `  ‚Ä¢ Year 2 Operating Costs:  $${year2Total.toLocaleString()}\n`;
report += `  ‚Ä¢ Year 3 Operating Costs:  $${year3Total.toLocaleString()}\n`;
report += `  ‚Ä¢ Year 5 Operating Costs:  $${year5Total.toLocaleString()}\n\n`;
```

**Result:** Report now includes actionable context for financial decision-making ‚úÖ
