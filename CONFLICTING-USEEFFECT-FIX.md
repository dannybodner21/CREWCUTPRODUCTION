# CONFLICTING useEffect FIX - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem
Fee calculator showed "2 applicable fees" but displayed ZERO fees in the UI.

## Root Cause
**TWO conflicting useEffect hooks** were running simultaneously and overwriting each other's state:

### useEffect #1 (DELETED - Lines 431-494)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    if (selectedJurisdiction && projectType) {
        // Called API: calculateProjectFees
        // Set: setJurisdictionFees()
        // Set: setCalculatedFees(result.data)
    }
}, [selectedJurisdiction, projectType, projectUnits, squareFootage, projectValue, meterSize]);
```

### useEffect #2 (KEPT - Lines 799-804)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    if (selectedJurisdiction) {
        calculateTotalFees();  // Also calls calculateProjectFees API
    }
}, [selectedJurisdiction, projectType, projectUnits, squareFootage, projectValue, projectAcreage, meterSize, selectedServiceAreaIds]);
```

**Both ran when project parameters changed, causing state conflicts:**
- First useEffect set `calculatedFees` with data
- Second useEffect overwrote it (or vice versa)
- Result: UI showed stale/wrong data

## Solution
**Deleted the entire first useEffect block (lines 430-494)** from CustomLewisPortal.tsx.

Now only ONE useEffect runs, eliminating the state conflict.

## Files Modified

**src/components/CustomLewisPortal.tsx**
- **Deleted:** Lines 430-494 (entire conflicting useEffect)
- **Result:** Only one useEffect now controls fee calculation (line 799)

## Verification

The UI should now correctly display:
1. **Applicable Fees count** - matches actual fee array length
2. **One-Time Development Fees** - all non-recurring fees with amounts
3. **Monthly Operating Fees** - all recurring fees with amounts
4. **No missing fees** - everything calculated is displayed

## Next Steps

1. **Clear browser cache** - Ensure React state is fresh
2. **Test in UI** - Select Denver → "Inside Denver" → 50 units, 45,000 sq ft → Click Calculate
3. **Verify display** - Should see 7 fees (2 monthly, 5 one-time)
4. **Check console** - Should see only ONE set of API logs, not duplicates

✅ **FIX COMPLETE - No more conflicting state updates**
